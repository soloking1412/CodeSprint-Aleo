# CodeSprint-Aleo
## Aleo Private DAO Voting System Design
### Project Overview
The Aleo Private DAO Voting dApp allows DAO members to vote on proposals securely and privately using zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP). This ensures that votes are anonymous while maintaining the integrity of the voting process on the Aleo blockchain.

Votes are counted, and the proposal is accepted or rejected based on the majority.
Example User Flow
Proposal: Alice submits a proposal.
Ticket Issuance: Alice issues tickets to DAO members.
Voting: Members like Bob vote "Agree," while Charlie votes "Disagree."
Result: Votes are tallied, and the proposalâ€™s outcome is announced.
